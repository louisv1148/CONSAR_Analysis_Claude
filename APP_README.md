## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that the database file exists
- Verify Python virtual environment is activated

**No data for selected period**
- Check available periods in the data overview
- Verify the database contains data for that period
- Some periods may only have MXN data, not USD

**Export not working**
- Ensure openpyxl is installed for Excel exports
- Check browser download permissions
- Try refreshing the page and regenerating

### Performance Tips
- Use caching by not changing periods frequently
- Select only needed tables to reduce processing time
- For large datasets, consider using CSV exports over Excel
